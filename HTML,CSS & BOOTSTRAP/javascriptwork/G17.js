/*
function word is replaced with => on the right side of arguments list
{} can be removed if there is only one statement in the body of the function
if {} are not there, then "return" is implicit. 
if {} are there, then return should be used explicitly.
if there is only one argument, the () brackets are not required.
However, if there are no arguments or more than one arguments, the () brackets are mandatory.
